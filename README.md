# Creature Drive

## Introduction
This repository is the collection of codes, assets, .apk files, etc of my work of a 3D multiplayer fighting game with AR and gyrometer, which is intended to be built especially on Android. In this game, we can choose 1 out of 2 characters which are all monsters. We will use the monster to battle with another player in a room/stage.

## Preparation Before Usage
As the explanation above suggests, it is an AR game so that the player will need to use the certain marker for this game (Creature Drive marker.png). You could either print it out or just point your camera towards a screen which is displaying it. The character and stage will appear on the marker.

Here is the marker we use (Creature Drive marker.png)

## How to use
- Immediately download and install the CreatureDriveOnline.apk on your Android device
  - Since the .apk file is too big, I put it on Google Drive with the following link:
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3KdF6s4aX9vblRyTkE4QU9EdDA/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-hnMuxC5qjWb5jsGYFdQ6GQ
- Open the project with Unity 3D engine

## Controls and Gameplay
The character controls consist of two parts, movement and rotation. For movements, there are eight movement button towards 8 directions. To rotate your character, simply tilt your device as the character will rotate based on the gyrometer in it. 

Every character has 2 bars, HP and MP. The winner is the first to deplete the other player's character's HP by attacking.

There are 3 kinds of attacks, they are normal attack, special attack, and super attack. Initial MP value is 0 and will fill up if the character is attacked or its attack hits the opponent. Special attack uses one-third of MP bar and super attack uses a full bar.


Thank you.
